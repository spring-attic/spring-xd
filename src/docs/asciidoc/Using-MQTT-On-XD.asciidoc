== Using MQTT Modules

=== Introduction
MQTT(MQ for telemetry transport) is a machine to machine connectivity protocol. It is a lightweight pub/sub protocol for devices where bandwidth and battery power are at a premium.  This purpose of this document is to show you how to: enable the RabbitMQ MQTT plugin, setup a Spring XD MQTT source and Spring MQTT sink. 

NOTE:  This document assumes that you have a RabbitMQ installed and running.  If you don’t have RabbitMQ available already you can download it from http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html.   

==== Setting up MQTT on RabbitMQ
If you are using RabbitMQ 3.3.4 or above then the MQTT plugin is already included with your deployment, however it is inactive.  
To Activate:

1. Shutdown the Rabbit MQ instance
2. $RABBIT_HOME/sbin/rabbitmq-plugins list
 
  ...
  [ ] rabbitmq_federation_management    3.3.4
  [E] rabbitmq_management               3.3.4
  [e] rabbitmq_management_agent         3.3.4
  [ ] rabbitmq_management_visualiser    3.3.4
  [ ] rabbitmq_mqtt                     3.3.4
  [ ] rabbitmq_shovel                   3.3.4
  [ ] rabbitmq_shovel_management        3.3.4
  …
   
3.  We see that the rabitt_mqtt does not have a [E] denoted next to it.  Thus it is not enabled.  
Note: if you do see the [E] next to the rabbitmq_mqtt then your plugin is enabled and all you need to do is restart your RabbitMQ.
4. Now enable rabbit_mqtt plugin
  a. Run: $RABBIT_HOME/sbin/rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_mqtt
  b. Run: $RABBIT_HOME/sbin/rabbitmq-plugins list
 
  ...
  [ ] rabbitmq_federation_management    3.3.4
  [E] rabbitmq_management               3.3.4
  [e] rabbitmq_management_agent         3.3.4
  [ ] rabbitmq_management_visualiser    3.3.4
  [E] rabbitmq_mqtt                     3.3.4
  [ ] rabbitmq_shovel                   3.3.4
  [ ] rabbitmq_shovel_management        3.3.4
  ...

   c. Now we see that the rabbitmq_mqtt plugin is now active.
   d. Restart your RabbitMQ.
   
==== Rabbit MQTT Plugin settings
The MQTT plugin can be can be configured via the rabbitmq.config file and this is covered here: http://www.rabbitmq.com/mqtt.html.  
The settings for the MQTT plugin that Spring XD are concerned about are as follows:

1. allow_anonymous  Determines if the user must supply a user name or password.  If true then the plugin will use the default_user and default password enumerated below.  If false the Spring XD source or sink must provide the username and password  Default: true
2. default_user  If allow_anonymous is set to true then this will set the user for anonymous clients.  Default: guest
3. default_password If allow_anonymous is set to true then this will set the password for anonymous clients.  Default: guest 
4. exchange - The name of the exchange that will route all MQTT messages to a the  queues. Default: amq.topic
5. tcp_listeners - host and port that rabbit will monitor for MQTT messages. Default: 1883

Out of the box the Spring XD MQTT source and sink currently works with the MQTT plugin defaults without any configuration.     
   
==== MQTT Source
When Spring XD deploys the  MQTT source module, a message queue is created along with the necessary binding on RabbitMQ.  The message queue that is created will have the name structure `[mqtt-subscription-][client_id][srcqos1]`. 
* mqtt-subscription- Queues created for MQTT subscribers will have names starting with mqtt-subscription.
* client-id is the client-id specified by the MQTT source module, the default is `xd.mqtt.client.id`
* srcqos1 - The QoS level for the queue.

The MQTT source module also generates the binding from the amq.topic to the message queue via the routing key (topic).  The default topic for the MQTT source module is `xd.mqtt.test`.

===== Example 1: Using defaults
To show this in detail let us create the following stream: `stream create mqtt-in --definition “mqtt|log” --deploy`.  In this example the stream will retrieve MQTT messages from RabbitMQ and write the content to Spring XD’s log.  So on RabbitMQ a message queue named `mqtt-subscription-xd.mqtt.client.id.srcqos1` and a binding for the topic (routing key) `xd.mqtt.test` will be created.

Thus any message published with the topic, `xd.mqtt.test` will be sent to the `mqtt-subscription-xd.mqtt.client.id.srcqos1` message queue and thus picked up by the Spring XD MQTT module and then written to log.  
So to exercise the stream created we can write the following:

----
stream create --name rabbittest --definition "http|rabbit --exchange='amq.topic' --routingKey='''xd.mqtt.test'''" --deploy
http post --data 'hello world'
----

In the log you should see:

[source,bash]
----
09:53:34,487  INFO MQTT Call: xd.mqtt.client.id.src sink.mqtt-in - hello world
----

===== Example 2: Monitoring different topics. 
In this scenario we want to setup a MQTT Source Module to retrieve messages that may come in from different topics.  So lets pretend that we want to monitor all the infusion machines at a medical facility.  Our monitor wants to log all messages that notify us that a machine has completed its task or if a machine in need of  maintenance.  

image::images/mqtt_samp_2.png[MQTT Sample 2, width=500]

In this case it would look like this:

----
#Create a simulated device that will dispatch a patient alert message
stream create --name patientAlert --definition "http|rabbit --exchange='amq.topic' --routingKey='''patient.alert'''" --deploy
#Create a simulated device that will dispatch a patient notification message
stream create --name patientNotification --definition "http --port=9005|rabbit --exchange='amq.topic' --routingKey='''patient.notification'''" --deploy
# create our monitor that will capture the mqtt traffic.
stream create --name patientMonitor --definition "mqtt --topics=patient.alert,patient.notification |log" --deploy
----

Now lets dispatch messages to both topics:

----
http post --target http://localhost:9005  --data 'infusion complete'
http post --data 'pump failure'
----

In the log you should see:

[source,bash]
----
10:25:21,403  INFO MQTT Call: xd.mqtt.client.id.src sink.patientMonitor - infusion complete
10:25:46,226  INFO MQTT Call: xd.mqtt.client.id.src sink.patientMonitor - pump failure
----
   
==== MQTT Sink
The MQTT sink module will publish messages for a topic to the broker for a specific topic.  

===== Example 1: Using defaults
In this example we will create a stream that will publish a message to topic using the defaults: 

----
stream create mqtt-out --definition “http|mqtt” --deploy
stream create mqtt-in --definition”mqtt|log” 
----

This mqtt-out stream will receive http messages to port 9000 on localhost and then the mqtt will publish the information to a rabbit instance on the localhost.  The message will be routed to the queue (mqtt-subscription-xd.mqtt.client.id.srcqos1) that was created by MQTT source module and then, the message will be delivered to the MQTT source module.

image::images/mqtt_samp_3.png[MQTT Sample 3, width=500]

So the output will look something like this, if you execute a `http post --data ‘hello world’`

[source,bash]
----
14:03:57,340  INFO MQTT Call: xd.mqtt.client.id.src sink.mqtt-in - hello world
----

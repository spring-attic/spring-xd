== Admin UI

=== Introduction

Spring XD provides a browser-based GUI which currently has 4 sections:

* **Containers** Provides the XD cluster view with the list of all running containers
* **Streams** Deploy/undeploy Stream Definitions
* **Jobs** Perform Batch Job related tasks
* **Analytics** Create data visualizations for the various analytics modules

Upon starting Spring XD, the Admin UI is available at:

"http://<adminHost>:<adminPort>/admin-ui" 

For example: http://localhost:9393/admin-ui

If you have enabled https, then it will be located at https://localhost:9393/admin-ui

If you have enabled security, a login form is available at http://localhost:9393/admin-ui/#/login

**Note**: Default admin server port is `9393`

[[admin-ui-containers]]
=== Containers
The _Containers_ section of the admin UI shows the containers that are in the XD cluster.  For each container the group properties and deployed modules are shown.  More information on the container (hostname, pid, ip address) and for the module (module options and deployment properties) is available by clicking on the respective links.  You can also shutdown a container (in distributed mode) by clicking on the shutdown button.  You will be asked for confirmation if you select to shutdown.

[[admin-ui-streams]]
=== Streams

The _Streams_ section of the admin UI provides the _Definitions_ tab that provides a listing of Stream definitions. There you have the option to *deploy* or *undeploy* those streams. Additionally you can remove the definition by clicking on *destroy*.

=== Jobs

The _Jobs_ section of the admin UI currently has four tabs specific for *Batch Jobs*

* Modules
* Definitions
* Deployments
* Executions

[[admin-ui-modules]]
==== Modules

_Modules_ encapsulate a unit of work into a reusable component. Within the XD runtime environment Modules allow users to create definitions for _Streams_ as well as _Batch Jobs_. Consequently, the _Modules_ tab within the _Jobs_ section allows users to create _Batch Job_ definitions. In order to learn more about _Modules_, please see the chapter on xref:Modules#modules[Modules].

===== List available batch job modules

This page lists the available batch job modules.

.List Job Modules
image::images/spring-xd-admin-ui-list-modules.png[List Job Modules, width=500]

===== Create a Job Definition from a selected Job Module

On this screen you can create a new Job Definition. As a minimum you must provide a name for the new definition. Optionally you can select wether the new definition shall be automatically deployed. Depending on the selected module, you will also have the option to specify various parameters that are used during the deployment of the definition.

.Schedule a Batch Job
image::images/spring-xd-admin-ui-schedule-job.png[Schedule a Batch Job, width=500]

When clicking on *Schedule*, you have the option to run the job:

* using a fixed delay interval (specified in seconds)
* on a specific data/time
* using a valid CRON expression

==== Job Deployment Details

On this screen, you can view additional deployment details. Besides viewing the stream definition, the available Module Metadata is shown as well, e.g. on which Container the definition has been deployed to.

.Job Deployment Details

==== List job executions

This page lists the Batch Job Executions and provides the option to *restart* or *stop* a specific job execution, provided the operation is available.
Furthermore, you have the option to view the Job execution details.

.List Job Executions
image::images/spring-xd-admin-ui-executions.png[List Job Executions, width=500]

The list of Job Executions also shows the state of the underlying Job Definition. The following states can be shown.

[cols=".^1,.^4"]
|===

|image:images/spring-xd-admin-ui-jobs-job-execution-status-undeployed.png[Create Definition, 133, 36, title="Undeployed Job Definition"]
|The underlying Job Definition was undeployed.

|image:images/spring-xd-admin-ui-jobs-job-execution-status-deleted.png[Create Definition, 133, 36, title="Deleted Job Definition"]
|The underlying Job Definition was deleted.

|image:images/spring-xd-admin-ui-jobs-job-execution-status-composed.png[View Details, 133, 36, title="Composed Job Definition"]
|This is a composed Job Definition.

|===

As an example, we have created the following composed job using the Spring XD shell:

[source,bash]
----
spring> job create composed1 --definition "myjob" --deploy
spring> job create composed2 --definition "myjob" --deploy
spring> job create composedDemoJob --definition "composed1 || composed2" --deploy
spring> job launch composedDemoJob
----

Once executed, you should see the _composedDemoJob_ on the Job Execution page:

.Job Executions with Composed Job Execution
image::images/spring-xd-admin-ui-jobs-job-executions-composed.png[Composed Job Execution, width=500]

By clicking on the magnifying glass you will be able to see the composed job's details,
including the associated child Job Executions for the jobs _composed1_ and _composed2_.

===== Job execution details

.Job Execution Details of Composed Job
image::images/spring-xd-admin-ui-jobs-job-execution-details-composed.png[Composed Job Execution Details, width=500]

The list of Job Executions on the Job execution details page will only be visible for
composed jobs. In the case of a non-composed Job, you would see the following:

.Job Execution Details - Steps

On this screen, you can view various metrics associated with the selected step such as *duration*, *read counts*, *write counts* etc.

[[adminui-analytics]]
=== Analytics

The _Analytics_ section of the admin UI provides dashboarding and data visualization capabilities for the various analytics modules available in _Spring XD_:

* Counters
* Aggregate Counters
* Field-Value Counters
* Gauges
* Rich Gauges

For example, if you have created the `springtweets` stream and the corresponding counter in the <<counter, Counter chapter>>, you can now easily create the corresponding graph from within the **Dashboard** tab:

1. Under `Metric Type`, select `Counters` from the select box
2. Under `Stream`, select `tweetcount`
3. Under `Visualization`, select the desired chart option, `Bar Chart`

You will see a visualization similar to the following:

.Counter Bar Chart
image::images/spring-xd-admin-ui-analytics-counter-barchart.png[Analytics Bar Chart, width=500]

Under `Visualization`, select the desired chart option, `Graph Chart`

You will see a visualization similar to the following:

.Counter Graph
image::images/spring-xd-admin-ui-analytics-counter.png[Analytics Counter Graph, width=500]

Using the icons to the right, you can add additional charts to the dashboard, re-arange the order of created dashboards or remove data visualizations.

The remaining 3 tabs **Counters**, **Gauges** and **Rich-Gauges**, provide default visualizations for all _Spring XD_ counters within the system. For example, if you have created the <<simple-tap-example, Simple Tap Example>> (Rich Gauge) in the <<counter, Counter Chapter>>, you will see a visualization similar to the following under the _Rich-Gauges_ tab:

.Rich Gauge

/**
 * Adapts the item at a time delivery of a {@link org.springframework.messaging.MessageHandler}
 * by delegating processing to a {@link Stream}
 * <p/>
 * The outputStream of the processor is used to create a message and send it to the output channel. If the
 * input channel and output channel are connected to the MessageBus, then data delivered to the input stream via
 * a call to onNext is invoked on the dispatcher thread of the message bus and sending a message to the output
 * channel will involve IO operations on the message bus.
 * <p/>
 * The implementation uses a {@link reactor.core.processor.RingBufferProcessor} with asynchronous dispatch.
 * This has the advantage that the state of the Stream can be shared across all the incoming dispatcher threads that
 * are invoking onNext. It has the disadvantage that processing and sending to the output channel will execute serially
 * on one of the dispatcher threads.
 * <p/>
 * The use of this handler makes for a very natural first experience when processing data. For example given
 * the stream <code></code>http | reactor-processor | log</code> where the <code>reactor-processor</code> does does a
 * <code>buffer(5)</code> and then produces a single value. Sending 10 messages to the http source will
 * result in 2 messages in the log, no matter how many dispatcher threads are used.
 * <p/>
 * You can modify what thread the outputStream subscriber, which does the send to the output channel,
 * will use by explicitly calling <code>dispatchOn</code> or other switch (https://projectreactor.io/docs/reference/#streams-multithreading)
 * before returning the outputStream from your processor.
 * <p/>
 * Use {@link org.springframework.xd.reactor.MultipleBroadcasterMessageHandler} for concurrent execution on dispatcher
 * threads spread across across multiple Stream.
 * <p/>
 * All error handling is the responsibility of the processor implementation.

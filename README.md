Spring XD
=========

*Spring XD* makes it easy to solve common big data problems such as data ingestion and export, real-time analytics, and batch workflow orchestration.  By building on mature, open source projects such as Spring Integration, Data and Batch, Spring XD will simplify the process of creating real-word big data solutions.  XD stands for 'eXtreme Data' or 'x' as in y=mx+b :)

While it is possible today to build such solutions using Spring (see the [Spring Data Book][] for details and examples), Spring XD will move well beyond the framework API level by providing an out-of-the-box executable server, a pluggable module system, a high level configuration DSL, a simple model for distributing data processing instances on or off the Hadoop cluster, and more.

You can fork the repository and/or monitor JIRA to see what is going on. As always, we consider the feedback from our broad and passionate community to be one of our greatest assets.

## Documentation

Look for it on the [XD wiki](https://github.com/springsource/spring-xd/wiki). [API Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-xd/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/api/) (JavaDoc) is available as well. Please also visit the SpringSource.org [project website](https://www.springsource.org/spring-xd) for more information.

## How to build 

Check the documentation on how to build Spring XD [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-xd/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/#building-spring-xd).

## Contributing to Spring XD

Here are some ways for you to get involved 

* Create [JIRA](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/XD) tickets for bugs and new features and comment and vote on the ones that you are interested in.
* Follow the flow of developing on the [work board](https://jira.springsource.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=6).
* Github is for social coding: if you want to write code, we encourage contributions through pull requests from [forks of this repository](https://help.github.com/forking/).  If you want to contribute code this way, please familiarize yourself with the process outlined for contributing to Spring projects here: [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-integration/wiki/Contributor-Guidelines).

Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the [contributor's agreement](https://support.springsource.com/spring_committer_signup).  Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and given the ability to merge pull requests.

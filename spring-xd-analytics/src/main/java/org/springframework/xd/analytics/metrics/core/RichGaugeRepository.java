/**
 * A service for managing RichGauge instances.
 *
 * The setValue method updates the current value of the gauge as well as incrementing the internal counter and updating
 * the max, min and average values.
 *
 * It also provides a 'getOrCreate' method that will return an existing gauge given the name or create a new gauge set
 * to zero.
 *
 * Supports a "smoothing constant", "alpha" for use in calculating an <a
 * href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section4/pmc431.htm">exponential moving average</a> for the
 * gauge.
 * The parameter can be changed at any time after the gauge has been created. The mean calculated up to that point will
 * be used to initialize the moving average from that point on.
